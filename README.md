# StandardAaron.dev

This is a repo for my personal website.

Currently it's just an incomplete shell, but the eventual goal is to have links and info about my interests and adventures in tech.

The design will be a sort of mash-up homage to text-based games, text editors, and CLIs.

I've made this public because the website and all source will already be public in perpetuity.
